            Redesigning Chinatown's Website for Responsive Design
            <p></p>
            <div class="container">
            <img alt="Qries" src="assets/Chinatown.png"
            width="600" height="500">
            </div>
            I chose the Chinatown website as its a restaurant that I visit often, and I feel as though the interface is rather bland and uninspiring.
            <div>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            </div>

            
            Finding Problems
            <p></p>
            Usability Notes
            <ul>
                <li>Odd that "We Deliver" is not a button while "Order Online!" is</li>
                <li>Both Google Play and Apple Device buttons lead to dead ends</li>
                <li>Otherwise pretty clear and straightforward to navigate</li>
            </ul>

            Efficiency Notes
            <ul>
                <li>Having one long web page would provide an alternate way to access info outside of clicking headers</li>
                <li>Both an online ordering buttong and online ordering tab feels redundant</li>
            </ul>

            Learnability Notes
            <ul>
                <li>Very easy to learn as its a format of clicking buttons and headers to access relevant pages</li>
            </ul>

            Memorability Notes
            <ul>
                <li>Patterns of interaction are pretty clear as you link out to different pages</li>
            </ul>


            Accessibility
            <p></p>
            WAVE highlighted contrast issues present at the top menu bar where the "we deliver" and "order online" buttons lie.
            It also underscored the lack of heading structure on this webpage, making unclear for users which information is most important. On the other hand,
            the program stated that this webpage did a good job presenting alternate text to the pictures presented.
